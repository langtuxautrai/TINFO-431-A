                Introduction
            </h2>
            <p>
                Once we heard or listened to a song from somewhere and fell in love with it, we want to know about everything that relates to that song, such as the lyrics, the singer,
                the composer, and even the producer. Unfortunately, everything relates to that song is not available in one place. We have to go into many websites to collect information
                that we need. We may spend a lot of time and might end up not finding all the information we need. The objective of this project is to create a website where the user will
                be able to quickly and easily be able to search, review, modify, create and organize the music depend on genres, artists, composers, and producers.

            <h2>The description of project:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    We decide to make our project is a website like a wiki website for Music. Our current website has 5 categories: Songs, Artists, Albums, Composers, and Companies tabs.
                    We finished some functions on each tabs such as:
                </li>
                <li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>We have a Search function with auto-completed.</li>
                        <li>We can sort the table by clicking on the column name.</li>
                        <li>We can click on the song title, album title, singer's name, composer's name, or company's name which linked to the detail pages.</li>
                        <li>we replaced the "Create" link by the "Add New Song" button and this function can see only if you are a member of our website or Administrator account.</li>
                        <li>Songs details page has embedded with Youtube player. You can play it if that song has Youtube link with it.</li>
                        <li>"Edit" buttons will appear if you log in as a member.</li>
                        <li>The "Delete" buttons will only appear when we login as admin. You only delete if it is not bind with it.</li>
                        <li>In our models, we also use data annotations and validation in order to customize our input and output.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    There are 2 database schemas in our project: One for user database, we basically have the same schema as the default user database that is created by the ASP.NET NVC with the added roles.
                    One for music database schema, we have the following schema:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Company can have many composers, artists, and albums.</li>
                        <li>Artist and composer can only work for one company or work independence. The artist can have many albums and sing many songs. The composer can compose many songs.</li>
                        <li>Album can have many songs, and each album can only belong to one artist and be label by one company.</li>
                        <li>Song can only compose by one composer and sing by one singer, and it may not in or only in one specific album.</li>
                    </ol>
                    However, we merged 2 seperate database schemas into one database as MusicContext and store on the SQL Server of Microsoft Azure.

            </ul>
