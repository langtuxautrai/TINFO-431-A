                Introduction
            </h2>
            <p>
                Once we heard or listened to a song from somewhere and fell in love with it, we want to know about everything that relates to that song, such as the lyrics, the singer,
                the composer, and even the producer. Unfortunately, everything relates to that song is not available in one place. We have to go into many websites to collect information
                that we need. We may spend a lot of time and might end up not finding all the information we need. The objective of this project is to create a website where the user will
                be able to quickly and easily be able to search, review, modify, create and organize the music depend on genres, artists, composers, and producers.
            </p>

            <h2>The current scope of our project:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    We decide to make our project is a website like a wiki website for Music. Our current website has 5 categories: Songs, Artists, Albums, Composers, and Companies tabs.
                    We are currently working on the Songs and Albums pages. We finished some functions on the Songs and Albums tabs such as:
                </li>
                <li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>We have a Search function by title.</li>
                        <li>We can sort the table by clicking on the column name.</li>
                        <li>We can click on the song title, album title, singers, or composer which linked to the detail pages</li>
                        <li>we replaced the "Create" text by the button</li>
                        <li>The "delete" function will only appear when we login as admin</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Right now, we have 2 seperate database files: one for our music data and one for our user data.
                    For user database, we basically have the same schema as the default user database that is created by the ASP.NET NVC with the added roles.
                    For music database schema, we have the following:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Company can have many composers, artists, and albums.</li>
                        <li>Artist and composer can only work for one company or work independence. The artist can have many albums and sing many songs. The composer can compose many songs.</li>
                        <li>Album can have many songs, and each album can only be label by one company.</li>
                        <li>Song can only compose by one composer and sing by one singer, and it may not in or only in one specific album.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    In our models, we also use data annotations and validation in order to customize our input and output.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>For our final project scope:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>We will combine 2 seperate database files into one file.</li>
                <li>
                    We will modify the role of user such that anonymous people can only view and search data; members can view, search, create and edit but can not delete data from website;
                    and admin user can do everything.
                </li>
                <li>We will modify and set the restriction on the input such as the length of input.</li>
                <li>We also improve our design or the look and feel of our website by adding bootstrap, Ajax, JQuery and Script</li>
            </ol>
